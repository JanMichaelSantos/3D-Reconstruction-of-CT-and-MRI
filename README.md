This repository contains the dataset, codes, and results used in the paper "3D Reconstruction of Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for Enhanced Patient Diagnosis". The program was built using Python 3.10, and a complete list of the required libraries and modules can be seen in "requirements.txt"
<br> Since the whole dataset can't be uploaded here due to its filesize, a link is provided instead.
<br> For testing purposes, only a part of the dataset is uploaded.
